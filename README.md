# Targeted Web Scraper for ESPN Content 🏈

A Selenium-based Python script that automates navigation from Google Search to a specific NFL team page on ESPN (Baltimore Ravens), then drills down into the team’s **Roster** and selects **Lamar Jackson's** player profile.

## 🎯 What It Does

This script automates the following steps using a real browser (Chrome):

1. Opens Google and searches for the Baltimore Ravens ESPN team page.
2. Clicks the first result leading to ESPN.
3. Waits for and clicks the **Roster** tab.
4. Waits for and clicks the **Lamar Jackson** player link.
5. Keeps the page open for 500 seconds before closing.

This project demonstrates the power of Selenium for automating real-world browsing tasks and scraping targeted web content.
